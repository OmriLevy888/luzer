# Luzer
-------

Luzer is a short script to transfer events from a master calendar to shadow calendars. It supprots any amount of shadow calenars.

Luzer does not copy any description points from the master calendar to the shadow calendars (TODO: consider adding this as a switch).

Luzer only copies the current week from the master calendar (TODO: consider making this adjustable).
